  <h1>TSFL - EUROS (2019)</h1>
</p>

Thalish Saka Football League â€¢ Est. 2017

Inspired by the football franchise created by TAYFUN7, TSFL is a re-creation of TPS which is fueled by the community. We have created a enjoyable experience where players can play a close representation of the beautiful game which is football.

TSFL was originally created as a way for players to compete in a league/tournament format. Since then it has evolved to be more than that. You can read more about this via our socials.
